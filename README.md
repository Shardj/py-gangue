# Project on hold because I'm making a framework for this first

## BrigadeTracker
The follow up to my karma tracker bot (which I never finished), looking back at it it's a horrible mess so instead of fixing it I'm just going to start over and do it properly

Built on linux Ubuntu, but should work fine for other linux systems

## Commands
* Setup everything: `bot setup`
  * Setup database: `bot setup database`
  * Install requirements: `bot requirements install`
* Run all tests: `bot test` or `bot test all`
  * TODO add `bot test specific TESTNAME`
* Requirements. `bot requirements` will run all commands for this section
  * List missing requirements: `bot requirements check`
  * Install any missing requirements: `bot requirements install`
